% This is the file for exercise 1c in Project 1

A list of what we are supposed to do from the exercise text:

\begin{itemize}

\item Use thereafter the fact that the matrix has identical matrix elements along the diagonal and identical (but different) values for the non-diagonal elements. Specialize your algorithm to the special case and find the number of floating point operations for this specific tri-diagonal matrix. 

\item Compare the CPU time with the general algorithm from the previous point for matrices up to  $n=10^6$ grid points. 

\end{itemize}
