% This is the file for exercise 1d in Project 1

A list of what we are supposed to do from the exercise text:

\begin{itemize}

\item Compute the relative error  in the data set $i=1,\dots, n$,by setting up

\[
   \epsilon_i=log_{10}\left(\left|\frac{v_i-u_i}
                 {u_i}\right|\right),
\]
as function of $log_{10}(h)$ for the function values $u_i$ and $v_i$.
For each step length extract the max value of the relative error.  

\item Increase $n$ to $n=10^7$ and make a table of the results and 
comment your results. You can use either the algorithm from b) or c). 
\end{itemize}
