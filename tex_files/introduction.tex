In this project we got familiar with C++ and different aspects of numerical calculations. We examined round-off errors, floating point operations and the CPU time of different methods. We used both Gaussian elimination and LU decomposition to solve Poisson's equation for a certain function, $f(x)$, in our program. The source code can be found in the git repository:\\ https://github.com/vildemjo/Project1.

The report starts with some theory on how to transform the analytical continuous equation to a discrete matrix equation. On this form, the problem can be solved numerically with different methods. After that, the different algorithms belonging to the different methods are described. Then, the results are presented. They include the solution of Poisson's equation compared to the analytical solution, with the error development, and the CPU time of the different methods. In the end a discussion about floating point operations, round-off errors and CPU time is given. At last the report is summarized in the conclusion.

All the theory and methods are based on chapters 2 and 6 from Jensen, \cite{Jensen}
