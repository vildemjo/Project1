We have studied the solution to a tridiagonal matrix by using a general, Gaussian elimination method, a specialized Gaussian elimination method and LU-decomposition, in order to do numerical derivation. By changing the step-size we have found that the relative error of the solutions  genearly decreases until at a certain step-size, round-off errors increase the error. The computational cost was also analyzed for the three methods.
