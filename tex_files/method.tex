\subsection{Algorithm}

The first algorithms that we used are based on Gaussian elimination. This method starts by making the matrix upper triangular, thereafter one can solve the set of linear equations by starting at the bottom of the matrix where there are only one unknown. 

Our matrix is a tridiagonal matrix and therefore, just a few matrix operations were necessary to make the matrix upper triangular. Those are called forward substitution. The process of solving the set of equation from the bottom is called backward substitution.

\subsection{The general tridiagonal matrix}
The algorithm is first written for an equation with a general tridiagonal matrix on the short form:
\[
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{b}
\]
The full form looks like this:
\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    	d_1& e_1& 0 &\cdots & 0 &0 \\
        c_1 & d_2 & e_2 &0 &\cdots &0 \\
        0&c_2 &d_3 & e_3 & \cdots & 0 \\
        \vdots& \vdots & \ddots &\ddots &\ddots & \vdots \\
        0&0 & \cdots &c_{n-2} &d_{n-1}& e_{n-1} \\
        0&0 & \cdots & 0  &c_{n-1} & d_n \\
        \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	v_1\\
	v_2\\
	v_3\\
	\vdots\\
	v_{n-1}\\
	v_{n}\\
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
	b_1\\
	b_2\\
	b_3\\
	\vdots\\
	b_{n-1}\\
	b_{n}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The method used to solve the equation numerically was to first to a forward substitution to obtain a upper triangular matrix and then a backwards substitution to obtain the solution.

The algorithm preformed on the matrix values was:

\hspace{1cm}\linebreak
The values on the diagonal:
\[
\tilde{d_i} =  d_i - \left(\frac{c_i \cdot e_i}{\tilde{d}_{i-1}}\right)\linebreak
\]
The values on the right side of the equation:
\[
\tilde{b_i} =  b_i - \left(\frac{\tilde{b}_{i-1} \cdot e_i}{\tilde{d}_{i-1}}\right)
\]
for $i = 2, \dots, n $

\paragraph{The backward substitution:\hspace{4cm}}

\hspace{1cm}\linebreak
\[
v_i = \frac{\left(\tilde{b}_i + v_{i+1}\right)}{\tilde{d}_i}
\]
for $i = 2, \dots, n $. The boundary values are known ($v_0 = v_{n+1} = 0$). $v_{n}$ was calculated first and like this:
\[
v_{n} = \frac{\tilde{b}_{n}}{\tilde{d}_{n}}
\]

\subsection{This specific tridiagonal matrix}

The matrix in our case had the same values on the different diagonals:
\begin{multicols}{3}
\[
d_i = 2
\]

\[
e_i = -1
\]

\[
c_i = -1
\]
\end{multicols}

We can then pre-calculate some of the operations in the algorithm and if becomes then:

\paragraph{The forward substitution:\hspace{4cm}}

\hspace{1cm}\linebreak
The values on the diagonal:
\[
\tilde{d_i} =  d_i - \left(\frac{c_i \cdot e_i}{\tilde{d}_{i-1}}\right) = 2 - \left(\frac{(-1) \cdot (-1)}{\tilde{d}_{i-1}}\right) = 
\]
\[
2 - \frac{1}{\tilde{d}_{i-1}} =  \frac{i + 1}{i}
\]

The last expression can be shown to be true, by calculating some of the first values:
\[
\tilde{d}_2 = 2 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = \frac{2 + 1}{2}
\]
\[
\tilde{d}_3 = 2 - \frac{1}{\frac{3}{2}} = 2 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{12}{6} - \frac{4}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} = \frac{3+1}{3}
\]

The values on the right side of the equation:
\[
\tilde{b_i} =  b_i - \left(\frac{\tilde{b}_{i-1} \cdot e_i}{\tilde{d}_{i-1}}\right) = b_i - \left(\frac{\tilde{b}_{i-1} \cdot (-1)}{\tilde{d}_{i-1}}\right) = b_i + \left(\frac{\tilde{b}_{i-1}}{\tilde{d}_{i-1}}\right)
\]
for $i = 2,\, \dots\, , n $.

\paragraph{The backward substitution:\hspace{4cm}}

\hspace{1cm}\linebreak
\[
v_i = \frac{\left(\tilde{b}_i + v_{i+1}\right)}{\tilde{d}_i}
\]
for $i = 2, \dots, n-2 $. The boundary values are known ($v_0 = v_{n+1} = 0$). $v_{n}$ was calculated first and like this:
\[
v_{n} = \frac{\tilde{b}_{n}}{\tilde{d}_{n}}
\]

The last method that we tried out is called LU decomposition. When using this method we
