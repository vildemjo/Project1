We found that the LU-decomposition was by far the most costly algorithm and also heavily limited the step-size h of the computations. It was also found that the specialized algorithm was quite a lot faster compared to the general. This specialized algorithm was also possible to run with a higher level of resolution (lower h) with the benefit of the lowest relative errors of this experiment. 

The specialized algorithm requires more thinking in advance compared to the general, but is around twice as fast. However it is by far the more superior algorithm
