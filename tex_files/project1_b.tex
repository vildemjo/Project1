\begin{itemize}

\item Set up the general algorithm (assuming different values for the matrix elements) for solving this set of linear equations.

\item Find also the precise number of floating point 
operations needed to solve the above equations. 

\item Code the above algorithm and solve the problem for matrices of the size
$10\times 10$, $100\times 100$ and $1000\times 1000$.  That means that you select $n=10$, $n=100$ and
$n=1000$ grid points. 

\item Compare your results (make plots) with the closed-form solution for the different number of grid points  in the 
interval $x\in(0,1)$.  The different number of grid points corresponds to different step lengths $h$.

\end{itemize}
